                        <i>Inari</i> is a Third Person Advanture Game prototype developed with the Unity Engine in C#.
                        The player controls an undead fox on his quest for redemption after being killed in an apocalyptic human war.
                        The project was created by two fellow students and myself for a university course.

                        My tasks consisted of programming the prototype as well as modeling, texturing and animating the main character.
                        All other artistic content was created by my colleagues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since this was my first project in Unity and C#, the scope was rather small, but the goal was a well-rounded experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main focus of my tasks was to implement a believable movement system for the fox that included the states walking,
                        running, crawling, and jumping.
                    </p>
                    <p>This was accomplished by implementing the following components:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Camera-independent, directional movement</li>
                        <li>Smooth adaptation to changes in direction as well as to the slope of the surface</li>
                        <li>Responsive and fluid animations controlled by a simple state machine</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        In addition to the core traversal, a simple enemy type, a simple scripted dialog system,
                        and trigger-based gameplay events were implemented.

                        The project was primarily meant for learning the basics and core elements of creating gameplay systems.
                        Our goal of an appealing prototype was reached.
