                            <i>2446 - Anthropocene Rebirth</i> is the bachelor thesis of two fellow students and me.
                            The game is an online multiplayer-based RTT (Realtime Tactics) prototype developed using Unreal Engine 4
                            and a combination of C++ and Unreal's visual scripting language 'Blueprints'.

                            In Anthropocene Rebirth, you take control of a fleet of hovering warships to fight with them for dominance over resource points.
                            The objective is to conquer an ancient relic, thereby winning the match.
                            The key component is an in-match editor that allows you to change the weaponry of your warships inside the players'
                            base during the match.

                            My tasks were the technical and programmatic implementation of the prototype,
                            as well as shader development and user interface design.
                            All art related content was created by my colleagues.

                            Online synchronization is implemented using Unreal's built-in replication system and integrating Steam as a network layer.
                            We used a listen-server approach, where a player acts as both server and client at the same time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As needed for an RTT, I implemented a lobby system that allows players to create new lobbies,
                            browse and join existing ones, and set their teams, factions, maps, and game modes before the actual match begins.
                            Within the match, only game-relevant elements are replicated from the server to the client, such as ship movement,
                            turret firing or unit visibility.

                            To add depth to units, Unreal's Gameplay Ability System (GAS) is used, which mainly handles attributes,
                            stats and state changes. GAS encourages you to create a gameplay framework based mainly on running lots of small,
                            simple pieces of code and adding tags to objects, rather than creating large, complicated classes and hard dependencies.
                            Once you've built a foundation with this system, you can easily add new content and mechanics on top of it.

                            Using GAS really opened my eyes to how modular gameplay systems can be approached.

                            Last but not least, data handling was an essential part of this project.
                            With a modular approach to ship weaponry, we needed enough 'metadata' from objects to display important information
                            or create the objects themselves. Here I used Unreal's Primary Asset Data classes and its Asset Manager in combination
                            with Class Default Objects (CDO) to dynamically load, use, and unload needed information.

                            The Bachelor's thesis was an ambitious project with a hard and time-consuming learning curve.
                            But finishing it took me a big step forward in thinking about and implementing new gameplay and core mechanics for a game project.
