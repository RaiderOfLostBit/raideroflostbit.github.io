                            <i>Meruui</i> is a third-person adventure game prototype developed in Unreal Engine 4 with
                            its visual scripting language 'Blueprints'.
                            In Meruui, you take control of Laitari, a member of the Meruui tribe who is searching
                            for his outcast sister in a frozen, hostile world.
                            I realized this prototype with two fellow students for a university course.

                            The scope of the prototype was one polished level of an actual game.
                            I was responsible for programming the prototype as well as creating the shaders,
                            the user interface and modeling, texturing and animating the main character and creatures.
                            All other art was created by my team members.

                        <p>
                            My main focus throughout the project was to take an deeper look into building a third person control
                            and animation system with combat elements based on the
                            <a href="https://youtu.be/yTniZCOCY7o">Advanced Locomotion System V3</a>
                            plugin by LongmireLocomotion and Unreals default movement component.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first challenge was to model and rig a humanoid character and make it compatible with Unreals skeleton
                            and therefore to make use of the plugin's animations. For this, Unreals ARTv1 Maya plugin was used.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The key component to giving our character a custom feel in the animations is a state machine of
                            small additive animations and poses built on top of the plugin system, mainly controlling the upperbody region.
                            Full body root motion animations are used for custom animation bits, such as being hit by an enemy or pulling a lever.

                        <p>
                            The logic for combining animations and gameplay elements was mostly build around a range of global events,
                            such as pressing a certain key, interacting with an object or entering different movement states.
                            This event logic was also used for scripting level and gameplay-events in the demo.

                            In retrospect, I'm very pleased with the visual, athmospheric and fluid to play result of the prototype.
