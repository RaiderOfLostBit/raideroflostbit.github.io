                            After moving from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5, the best improvement besides
                            the stunning visual upgrades is the engine's focus on a more modular approach to game systems.

                            plugins are really pushing the  ability to separate game systems into their own modular pieces.

                        <p>
                            As I began to learn how the plugins worked, mainly using the
                            <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/paths/Z4/lyra-starter-game" target="_blank">Lyra Starter Game</a>
                            as an example, the idea came to my mind to use the modular approach for
                            handling the user interface in an RTT game project I was working on.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Based on the Data Registry,
                            <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/en-US/common-ui-plugin-for-advanced-user-interfaces-in-unreal-engine/" target="_blank">Common UI</a>,
                            Common Game (Lyra) and UI Extensions (Lyra) plugins, the modular approach was implemented.
                            The goal was to loosen dependencies within the UI flow and provide the ability to dynamically
                            extend the UI from various independent plugin sources as needed.
                        </p>

                            <h5>Data Registry Plugin</h5>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            The idea makes heavy use of the Data Registry plugin.
                            This plugin consists of global Data Registry assets that can be extended throughout
                            the project from various Data Table sources.
                            A single registry entry is defined by a unique name and an arbitrary data structure.
                            This structure must be identical for the entire registry.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Main advantages are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Data sources can be added and removed at runtime as needed.</li>
                            <li>Namespaces for unique names can be based on Gameplay Tags so their hierarchy can be used.</li>
                            <li>Registry entries can be overriden by data sources with higher priority.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div class="content-text-section-small">
                            <h5>Custom Approach</h5>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            For the custom User Interface, a Data Registry is defined for widget references.
                            Unique names are handled by Gameplay Tags, and the data structure
                            contains a soft reference to the actual widget class to display.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, if you want to create a widget, only its Gameplay Tag is required to find the widget
                            reference and display it in the UI. Since the widget classes are implemented as soft references,
                            loading times must be respected.
                            The Common Game (Primary Game Layout) and Common UI (Lazy Widget) plugins can be used to simplify this.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since Gameplay Tags are used as keys, their hierarchy can be utilized to dynamically populate a tab list,
                            for example, by gathering all direct child tags of a base tag and searching the registry for available widget data entries.
                            By assigning different priorities to data sources, the displayed widgets can be easily changed
                            if the same key is overwritten. This can be used to create a basic UI as a programmer,
                            which can later be replaced by a fully designed variant of an artist.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In conjunction with Unreal's Game Feature plugin, UI implementations can be spread across
                            multiple plugins and are combined when the required features are loaded.
                            In theory, this could be used to swap out the entire interface design,
                            for example in a live service when switching to a Christmas theme.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Main advantages of the approach:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>High flexibility and iteration speed in User Interface creation.</li>
                            <li>No more hard dependencies on widget classes, only names or Gameplay Tags are used.</li>
                            <li>Game Feature plugins can be used to encapsulate UI content and load it only when needed.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Caveats:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Higher complexity and harder to understand because loose dependencies are based on names or Gameplay Tags only.</li>
