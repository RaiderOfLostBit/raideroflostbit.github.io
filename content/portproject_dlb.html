                        <i>Der letzte Bus</i> is a web-based, playable 2D experience developed in HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP.
                        <br>In <i>Der letzte Bus</i> you follow little Ember and her little brother Aiden as they try to escape
                        an apocalyptic hurricane by taking the last bus out of their hometown while trying to find their parents.
                        The project was made by seven fellow students and me for a university course.

                        For this project, I developed an HTML, CSS, and Javascript based framework to achieve our goal of creating
                        a game-like experience.
                        My other fellow students were responsible for creating the art, sound, music and php session backend.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A self-imposed goal of my group and me was to use as few plugins or pre-made content as possible.
                        For my part, I ended up using only preloadjs and soundjs from the createjs suite for preloading content and playing audio files.

                        Based on a class structure, a level-world is composed of multiple fixed parallax layers.
                        All these layers and the objects they contain are moved forward or backward at different speeds depending on
                        the size of the world and the current scroll position.
                        To ensure that each object has its fixed position in the world, custom resizing logic is used based on common 16:9 resolutions.

                        To detect whether objects are on the screen or interactions are possible, distance checks from the player to interactable
                        objects are calculated at fixed intervals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Almost all events, such as the appearance of an object on the screen or the start of an interaction by the player,
                        trigger custom JavaScript events.
                        These events are eventually picked up in a per level script that controls progress and gameplay events.

                        The approach of using only HTML, CSS, and Javascript has some advantages, but also caveats.
                        Advantages are broad compatibility with different browsers and easy-to-understand concepts.
                        The disadvantage is performance. Updating so many elements requires high browser performance.
                        To support less powerful devices, a version was implemented that only scrolls further when the player reaches the edge of the screen.

                        The project provided a good insight into what it means to accompany a complete experience from conception
                        to its final implementation.
