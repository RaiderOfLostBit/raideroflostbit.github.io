                            example and looking for a clean way to implement match-based multiplayer modes for an RTT game,
                            the Lyra Experience and Lyra Game Phase systems provided a good starting point to do so.

                            Lyra Starter Game is a free and complete game base for a match-based
                            third-person multiplayer shooter from Epic Games.
                            It implements the latest features of Unreal Engine 5 and
                            is a perfect starting point or learning resource for own games.

                        <p>
                            Based on the Lyra Experience and Game Phase systems, I created the custom
                            Game Feature Experience plugin and extended Game Phases with similarly functioning Player Phases.

                        <p>
                            The goal of these modifications is to get a more modular approach to implementing game modes
                            and to split the complexity of such modes into separate classes and pieces.
                        </p>

                            <h5>Game Feature Experience Plugin</h5>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Lyra Experiences uses the
                            <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/en-US/game-features-and-modular-gameplay-in-unreal-engine/" target="_blank">Game Feature and Modular Gameplay</a>
                            plugins of Unreal Engine 5 to replace most of the functionality you would implement in the regular Game Mode classes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When loading a level, an Experience Data Asset defines the plugins to load and
                            actions to perform to dynamically add content and functionality to the game as needed.
                            For example, instead of implementing specific logic in the Game Mode or other game framework classes themselves,
                            they are extended by components implementing this logic.
                            When the level is left, these extensions are removed again.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Which actions and plugins are used can be easily changed in the Experience Data during design time.
                            This makes it easy to swap out certain content or functionality while testing different implementations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the custom approach, the system was moved to a separate plugin which can be shared between different projects.
                            The state machine, managing loading and unloading of plugins and actions,
                            has been reworked as a task-based subsystem capable of outlasting level changes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Main advantages of the rework are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Plugin can be shared between projects.</li>
                            <li>Separation of functionality into multiple classes and tasks, which simplifies later changes or extensions.</li>
                            <li>Persistent state of the subsystem can be used to load/unload only changing game feature plugins.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <h5>Game und Player Phase Abilities</h5>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            To make the game mode even more modular, Lyra uses Unreal's
                            <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/en-US/gameplay-ability-system-for-unreal-engine/" target="_blank">Gameplay Ability System</a>
                            to implement so-called Game Phase Abilities. These abilities represent different phases of a match,
                            each containing its own functionality. The phases are identified by Gameplay Tags and
                            use the tag hierarchy to also support subphases.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, a match may have a general pre, playing, and post phase.
                            The playing phase may have a "sudden death" subphase which is triggered when certain conditions are met.
                            The playing phase remains active until the subphase starts the overall post phase, ultimately ending itself and its parent phase.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For our RTT game idea, it was necessary that each player can have his own phases as well.
                            Think of Battlefield, where you can stay in a spawn screen independent of the actual running match.
                            Which phase the player starts in when entering the game during a match can be determined on the server by the overall game phase.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Player phases are implemented similarly to Game Phases, but replication is a bit more tricky
                            since they run on both server and owning client, not only on server.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Main advantages are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Robust and easier to handle solution for implementing independent game and player phases.</li>
                            <li>Replication of phases is mostly handled by the existing Gameplay Ability System.</li>
                            <li>Fully implementable in Blueprints for fast iteration speed.</li>
