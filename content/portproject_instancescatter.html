                            The custom Instance Scatter plugin for Unreal Engine provides a system to scatter mesh instances
                            across defined level areas. I developed it based on the idea of the
                            <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/simple-scatter" target="_blank">Simple Scatter</a>
                            by ArmyOfOneGames. The plugin was initially developed for Unreal Engine 4 and later ported to Unreal Engine 5.

                        <p>
                            Used for an RTS game idea by two friends and me, the plugin was developed to help us to create
                            convincing procedural foliage areas such as forests in a short period of time.
                            As the build-in tools do not offer a non-destructive workflow for placing foliage, making iterations is very time-consuming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The target of the plugin was to reduce the iteration time by keeping the visual quality as good as possible.
                        </p>

                            <h5>Functionality</h5>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            For better reusability and fast iteration, the system defines two types of assets, the Foliage Type and the Foliage Collection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Foliage Type asset is derived from a class used by the build-in foliage tools
                            but has been extended to include custom scatter parameters.
                            A Foliage Type defines the mesh used, its offset, rotation, collision, ground adjustment and a range of other parameters.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Foliage types are then assigned to a Foliage Collection Asset, where you specify each type's spawn probability and
                            its distribution chance within a defined area gradient.
                            In a collection, you can specify the composition of, for example, a forest area.

                            The single foliage type on the left is assigned to a collection defining a forest area.

                        <p>
                            The Scatter Collection is assigned to a Scatter Actor within a level.
                            This actor is a manager that creates a grid of possible instance positions and controls the scattering process itself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Created positions are then filtered or additionally generated by so-called Scatter Modifier Actors,
                            which can be assigned to a Scatter Actor. Currently, there are three types of modifiers:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Spline: The modifier filters positions based on an area within or around a spline component</li>
                            <li>Stamp: Valid positions are controlled by a texture mask projected onto a world surface</li>
                            <li>Line generator: Returns positions along a spline component with adjustable spacing and
                                optional additional radial spread around these positions</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Each Modifier can be additive or destructive, meaning it can add or remove individual foliage positions as needed.
                        </p>
