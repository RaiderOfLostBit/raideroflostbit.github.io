                    <p>
                        Based on the concept of the
                        <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/simple-scatter" target="_blank">Simple Scatter</a>
                        plugin by ArmyOfOneGames, I implemented a toolset to scatter mesh instances across defined level areas.
                        Currently, it is used to procedurally create foliage or  water surfaces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To scatter foliage, you must first define a Foliage Type Asset.
                        This asset is used by the build-in tools but has been extended to include custom scatter parameters.
                        A Foliage Type defines the mesh used, its offset, rotation, collision, ground adjustment and a range of other parameters.
                        The foliage type is then assigned to a Scatter Collection Asset, where you specify the  type's spawn probability
                        and its distribution chance within a defined area gradient.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Scatter Collection is assigned to a placed Scatter Actor within a level.
                        This actor is a manager that creates a grid of possible instance positions and controls the scattering process itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Created positions are then filtered or additionally generated by so-called Scatter Modifiers,
                        which can be assigned to a scatter actor. Currently there are three types of modifiers:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spline: The modifier filters positions based on an area within or around a spline component</li>
                        <li>Stamp: Valid positions are controlled by a texture mask projected onto a world surface</li>
                        <li>Line generator: Returns positions along a spline component with adjustable spacing and optional
                            additional radial spread around these positions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        For water surfaces, the same modifiers are used, but with a simpler scattering method that creates a grid of planes
                        within the modifier ranges.

                        A feature of Unreal Engines Landscape Layer System are Blueprint Brushes. They are used to
                        procedurally generate Height- and Weightmaps of landscapes.

                        The Unreal Engine's Landmass plugin contains a number of useful Blueprint Brushes, but they are not yet polished and therefore difficult to use.
                        The main purpose of my Blueprint Brush Collection plugin is to polish up these brushes, fix minor issues
                        and make them easy to use. Weightmap influences are currently ignored as we don't need them in our project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I liked the idea of the Total War Shogun Map Editor, where you can project heightmap textures anywhere on
                        the landscape to create mountains and interesting terrain.
                        I implemented the same approach as a custom blueprint brush. Together with our Landscape Auto-Material,
                        this allows us to quickly create believable, natural landscapes.
