                        Based on an idea of a new RTS game by two friends and me, I needed to implement a custom toolset
                        for the Unreal Engine Editor that would allow us to more easily create large game worlds from close-up views
                        to large top-down vistas. The tools were developed as editor plugins to keep them encapsulated and independent of projects.

                        <h5>RVT Painting</h5>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        RVT Painting is a custom editor mode for texturing landscapes that offers a more modular texturing and painting approach
                        than the built-in tools.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Normally in Unreal, you have to create a complex landscape material with all the layers you need already defined,
                        which can then be painted onto the landscape. If you have a limited team size, it can be difficult to mantain this material.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've always liked the approach that Cryengine takes, where you can create paint layers dynamically as needed.
                        With that in mind, the custom approach makes use of Unreal's Runtime Virtual Texturing System,
                        which is basically a material caching method that reduces render times but increases vram consumption.
                        The ability to render meshes with their materials into this cache and then project them onto a landscape is
                        used to create the layer-based texturing system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the custom system, each layer has its own RGB weightmap, so three different ground types can be painted per layer.
                        Layers can be created or removed dynamically.
                        Each layer uses an assignable Material Instance that defines the ground types, and a sort index.
                        By changing the sort index, the order of the layers can be adjusted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Material Instance uses Unreal's Material Layer system to specify each ground type as well as its blending.
                        Several presets for ground and blend types are included, making it easier for artists to use them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main components of the systems are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dynamic creation or removal of painting layers</li>
                        <li>Dynamic sorting of painting layers as well as locking layers and switching visibility</li>
                        <li>Easy swapping of the used Material Instance for a layer, changing its ground types and blending</li>
                        <li>Custom controls for painting, taking into account industry shortcuts</li>
                        <li>Each ground type can have its own physical material as well as its own grass type</li>
                    </ul>

                        Caveats
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>High VRAM consumption as two Runtime Virtual Textures are required for now (can be reduced by
                            creating Virtual Textures of high mip levels in the final production phase)</li>
                        <li>Rendering issues while painting (4.27)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Runtime Virtual Texture is further used for performant Landscape decals, paths and roads.</p>
