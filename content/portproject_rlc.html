                            Since I played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_in_Conflict" target="_blank">World in Conflict</a>
                            back in the day, I wanted to create a game featuring a similar level of dynamic terrain deformation.
                            So when I started to develop my own RTS together with two friends, this was one of the first fixed features to be implemented.

                            A few months later, it resulted in my Runtime Landscape Collision system for Unreal Engine.
                            First developed for Unreal Engine 4, it was later ported to Unreal Engine 5.

                        <p>
                            Prior to creating a custom solution, the free version of
                            <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/voxel-plugin-free" target="_blank">Voxel Plugin</a>
                            for Unreal was tested. However, to avoid problems with other previously created custom tools
                            such as the <a class="force-link" onclick="changeContent('project-rvtpainting');">RVT Painting Plugin</a>,
                            it was necessary to use the built-in landscape.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Based on this requirement, the system creates a runtime copy of Unreal's landscape collision data.
                            The duplicated data is used to modify collision information based on heightmaps, leading to a deformation of the landscape.
                        </p>
                        <div class="content-text-section-small">
                            <h5>Development</h5>

                        <p>
                            The first major challenge was to understand how the collision of a landscape is generated and handled.
                            Landscapes in Unreal use the heightfield collision implementation of the underlying physics system
                            (<a href="https://gameworksdocs.nvidia.com/PhysX/4.1/documentation/physxguide/Index.html" target="_blank">Nvidia PhysX</a> in Unreal Engine 4,
                            <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/en-US/physics-in-unreal-engine/" target="_blank">Chaos</a> in Unreal Engine 5).
                            Both systems are fortunately capable of adjusting this information at runtime.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A heightfield is basically a grid of vertices, each storing its own height information.
                            So a heightfield can only be deformed in the vertical axis, which makes things much easier.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After studying how the landscape is deformed using the built-in editor tools,
                            the idea was to create a decal like system using heightmaps to provide the deformation information.
                            These 'heightmap-decals' are captured to render targets and converted into relevant height information
                            using a custom shader-based material solution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now the performance-intensive part is reading the height from the render targets and updating the information
                            of each affected vertex. Reading the texture is done asynchronously, based on the approach Unreal uses
                            while editing the landscape in editor. Updating the vertices afterwards is almost synchronous, using Unreal's
                            <a href="https://isaratech.com/ue4-improving-speed-with-parallelfor/" target="_blank">ParallelFor</a> implementation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Vertex information is first updated in a custom cache, so changes can be reverted, for example,
                            if you want to place a building on a crater field. After the cache is updated, changes are pushed to the underlying physics layer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To reflect changes in collision, the visual landscape representation is updated by altering
                            the World Position Offset of each landscape component based on the height information
                            of the processed render targets.
                            Render bounds are adjusted to reflect these changes to avoid visual glitches.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The main advantages of the system are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Designer-friendly deformation of the native Unreal Engine landscape at runtime.</li>
                            <li>Support of additional creation of hole masks at runtime.</li>
                        </ul>

                            Caveats:

                        <ul>
                            <li>No support for World Composition or World Partition.</li>
                            <li>No support for dedicated servers (because of render target usage).</li>
